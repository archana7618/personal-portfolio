# 🧙‍♂️ User-Centric Technology & Product Enthusiast  

I believe in **user-centric designs and products**. Technology should be **seamless and self-explanatory**.

I work with both **edge and cloud solutions**, honed through countless product releases, which gives me **versatility in technical and product release cycles**.  

## 🌍 Passions Beyond Tech  
Beyond technology, I am passionate about **zero waste, gardening, and activities that connect me to planet Earth**.  

## 🚀 Continuous Learner & Team Player  
I am an **avid learner** who never hesitates to wear multiple hats for the team. I **thrive in encouraging and empowering** those around me with my best knowledge.
